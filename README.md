# Xception-Keras
A cleaned version of XceptionNet in Keras, Xception is one of the best models used for Image Classification. 

Xception is a Convolutional Neural Network, which is capable of producing state-of-the-art results. Xception is comparatively a more efficient model and the weight files produced are also smaller compared to other models. 

You can use this cleaned version of the Xception model to produce state-of-the-art results, you can also train it on more datasets, the current weight files are the weights produced by training Xception on the ImageNet database.
